## Adding Your Project To The List

To add your project to the list, simply edit this `README.md` and make a pull request! You can add your project to one or both of the lists.

If your project is looking for contributors, then you can edit the following markdown and add it to the "Looking for Contributors" list:

```
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>)
![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/help%20wanted.svg)
```

If your project has good first issues for newcomers, then you can edit the following markdown and add it to the "Good First Issues" list:

```
[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/<REPO_OWNER>/<REPO_NAME>/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
```

An example diff of a pull request made to this `README.md` would look like:

```diff
